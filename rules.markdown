# Building Your Company

In MFØ, your company is made of two kinds of units: stations and mobile frames. The minimum and maximum number of units in your company depends on the scale of the battle you're playing and the number of players.

These are for full-scale battles:
- 2 players: 3 stations and 5-8 mobile frames.
- 3 players: 2 stations and 4-7 mobile frames.
- 4 players: 2 stations and 4-6 mobile frames.
Your company must also carry 3 1-shot rockets.

These are for skirmish-scale battles:
- 2 players: 2 stations and 3-5 mobile frames.
- 3 players: 2 stations and 3-5 mobile frames.
- 4 players: 2 stations and 2-4 mobile frames.
Your company must also carry 2 1-shot rockets.

It's not to your advantage to always just field the largest company you're allowed. See Rules preview: balance & victory for more about that.

For your stations, you can build anything that's stationary and valuable to defend or seize. A downed satellite, a drop ship, a cache of medical supplies, a research facility's data storage drives, a truck with a flat tire and a load of fresh peaches. Whatever.

A mobile frame is made of a frame and attached systems. A frame can carry at most 4 systems, and at most 2 systems of any given type, but is otherwise allowed to carry any mix of systems you want.

There are six types of systems:
- Defensive systems: armor, a shield, camoflage, stealth composite surfacing, ECM.
- Movement systems: jumpjets, wings, wheels.
- Surveillance/communications systems: a radio, a targeting laser, spotlights, a rifle scope.
- Hand-to-hand weapon systems: a shock baton, a combat knife, a repurposed jackhammer. 
- Direct fire weapon systems: an assault rifle, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a beam weapon.
- Artillery range weapon systems: a mortar, a sniper rifle, a railgun.

Weapon ranges in MFØ are exclusive. You can't attack with a direct fire weapon when you're in hand-to-hand range, and you can't attack with an artillery range weapon when you're within direct fire range.

In play, a frame's systems give you the dice you roll in order to do things, but I'll get into that later. For now, this should be enough to get you all building game-legal companies.




# Speccing a Frame

A mobile frame consists of a frame and a variety of systems. In action, the mobile frame's systems give you the dice you roll.

Absent systems, a mobile frame can do four things:
Defend itself;
Move, navigating around cover;
Spot a target who is within direct fire range and not in cover;
Attack a target at hand-to-hand range.

The dice:
Blue dice are for defending.
Green dice are for moving.
Yellow dice are for spotting targets for other mobile frames to attack.
Red dice are for attacking.
White dice are wild; use them for any of the above.

Each mobile frame provides 2 white dice (2W).

### Defensive

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 defensive systems: armor, a shield, camoflage, stealth composite surfacing, ECM. The first defense system adds 1 blue die (1B). The second defense system adds a second blue die (2B), and allows the mobile frame to act as cover to other mobile frames without risking damage itself.

### Movement

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 movement systems: jumpjets, wings, wheels. The first movement system adds 1 green die (1G), and allows the mobile frame to move through cover (otherwise, it has to go around it). The second movement system adds a second green die (2G).

### Surveillance/communications

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 surveillance/communications systems: a radio, a targeting laser, spotlights, a rifle scope. The first comms system adds 1 yellow die (1Y). The second comms system adds a second yellow die (2Y). Without any comms systems, the mobile frame can spot targets only within direct fire range and out of cover. With one comms system, the mobile frame can spot targets within direct fire range, but in cover. With two comms systems, the mobile frame can spot targets anywhere on the battlefield.

### Hand to hand weapons

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 hand-to-hand weapon systems: a shock baton, a combat knife, a repurposed jackhammer. The first adds 2 red dice at hand-to-hand range (2Rh). The second adds 1 red 8-sided die at hand-to-hand range (2+d8Rh).

### Direct fire weapons

A mobile frame can carry 0-2 direct fire weapon systems: an assault rifle, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a beam weapon. The first adds 2 red dice at direct fire range (2Rd). The second adds 1 red 8-sided die at direct fire range (2+d8Rd).

### Artillery weapons
A mobile frame can carry 0-2 artillery range weapon systems: a mortar, a sniper rifle, a railgun. The first adds 2 red dice at artillery range (2Ra). The second adds 1 red 8-sided die at artillery range (2+d8Ra).

### Split-range weapons
An advanced rule says that with everyone's approval, you can declare your weapon systems to be split-range. A split-range pistol, for instance, might add 1 red die at direct fire and 1 red die at hand to hand (1Rd & 1Rh), instead of 2 red dice at either (2Rd or 2Rh). A split-range assault rife with a scope might add 1 red die at direct fire range and 1 red die at artillery range (1Rd & 1Ra).

This is a way to hedge your bets, which will seem appealing at company design time. However, you'll find in play that MFØ is more likely to reward all-in commitment and full followthrough than bet hedging. I recommend splitting your weapons' ranges only when you have a solid strategy that calls for it.

### Additionally
A mobile frame can carry at most four systems.

It doesn't count as a system, but a mobile frame with no direct fire or artillery range weapons systems gets 1 green 8-sided die as well (d8G).

In addition to its frame and systems, a mobile frame can also carry up to 3 1-shot rockets. A 1-shot rocket provides 1 red d8 at direct fire range (d8Rd), once only. Discard it after you use it.

> ### The "Soldier" configuration
> 
> A soldier-configured frame carries one defensive system, one movement system, one comms system, and one direct fire weapon system. Compared to this configuration, every other mobile frame is a specialist of some sort, to some degree. When you're creating your frames, an easy way to start is to make a soldier configuration and then swap systems in and out to specialize as needed.




# Balance & victory
 
> When you're building your companies, MFØ doesn't require you to build to a certain number of points or balance your company against your opponents' or anything like that. Instead, it gives you some broad limits and lets you build your company just how you want it. When you come to the table to play, you compare your companies, and the game's victory conditions do the balancing.
> 
> Suppose that I drop Captain Hattapon with 6 hardass shock marines to put down one of these counterproductive seize-and-burn actions that you Free Colonists are always getting up to. I'm fielding 9 assets - my 7 mobile frames, plus 2 drop ships. You're fielding 7 assets - your 5 mobile frames, a protein processing silo, and a cache of ordnance (illegally seized). I outweigh you 9 to 7 and outgun you 7 to 5, just the way I like it.
> 
> Here's how the game makes it into a fair fight.
> 
> Because my company is larger and stronger than yours, assets are worth only 3 points to me, but 7 points to you. At the beginning of the battle, I have 9 assets, each worth 3 points, for a total of 27. But you have 7 assets, each worth 7 points, for a total of 49 points. You're winning! In order to win, I have to somehow close that gap and overtake you. Fielding the larger, stronger company puts me on the offensive.
> 
> 2 turns in, let's say that I've been able to concentrate my superior firepower and destroy one of your frames, but haven't lost one myself. I still hold 9 assets, so my score stays at 27. Now you hold 6 assets, so your score drops to 42.
> 
> 4 turns in, let's say that I destroy a second of your frames, but you take one of mine out too. Now I hold 8 assets so my score drops to 24, and you're down to 5 so yours drops to 35. You're still winning, and I'm starting to get desperate.
> 
> On the fifth turn, I make a costly hard advance, losing one of my frames but seizing that protein silo. I still hold 8 assets - I lost a frame but gained the silo - so my score holds at 24. You're down to 4 assets, though, so your score drops to 28.
> 
> Most battles last 6 turns. I've got this one last turn and you're still 4 points ahead. I'm battered, strung out along the battlefield, my drop ships are at this point undefended, and I still have to blow up another one of your frames, without losing another one of my own, to win.

So when you're building your company, choose whether you want to field a large company or a smaller one. Fielding a bigger company means that everything is worth less to you, so you have to accomplish more in order to win. You've got to be smart, fearless, aggressive and lucky. Fielding a smaller company means that everything is worth more to you, so you have to dig in, fight mean, and hold on to what you've got. Think strategically and plan for your position.




# Initiative

Let's say you've got 5 frames, Forged has 4, and I've got 4 too, but one of them only has three systems.

Each of us has two objectives.

Each objective or frame is an asset. Before we start to play, we assume each asset is worth 5 initiative points.

Who has the most frames? You. -1 initiative.
Who has the least? Forged and I do. +1 initiative.
Who has the most systems? You. -1 initiative.
Who has the fewest systems? Me. +1 initiative.

You get 5-1-1=3 initiative for each asset, of which you have 7. 7 * 3 = 21 initiative.
Forged gets 5+1=6 initiative for each asset, of which he has 6. 6 * 6 = 36 initiative.
I get 5+1+1=7 initiative for each asset, of which I have 6. 7 * 6 = 42 initiative. 

I have the highest initiative. I can either choose a frame to move or pass the option to Forged. He can opt to pass it to you. You don't have that option; you have the lowest initiative and have to take a turn.

When a player loses a frame or an objective, their initiative goes down by the amount you get for each asset. So let's say you guys take out a frame of mine. I lose 7 points, putting me at initiative of 35. That means Forged now has the initiative. Forged now gets the option to move a frame or pass the initiative to me. I can opt to pass it to you, just like before, and like before you have to go if I have.

When a player gains an objective, their initiative goes up by the amount they get for each asset. Let's say that frame of mine was guarding some peaches and you took them. You get 3 points, bringing you to 24. I lose 7 points, bringing me down to 28. We share a Forged-shaped problem. Let's go deal with that.

Now, this is the reason they're not quite victory points: while I have to hit or steal Forged's assets to win, you have to hit or steal stuff from both of us. That means that the initiative points say who's winning in the point race, but there's a point where you'll defect from your erstwhile ally (that's me) and start shooting me in the back when you have the opportunity. The points say, "Shoot at the winner!" but the circumstances say, "Defect! You can take them both!" ... and by that time in the game, I bet both of our companies are in pretty rough shape while you, as the "losingest" player, have taken relatively few hits. This is your moment to shine. If Forged and I have been moving back and forth a bunch, using our initiative immediately, that means you have a complete lay of the land by the time your turn comes around. You know which frames are in a weak position, which ones have poor defense numbers, and, most importantly, none of them can shoot back so you don't have to use white dice to defend yourself — you can use them for spotting, moving, and attacking.

And hey, if I pass initiative to you, and you shoot me in the back? Probably the best thing for me to do is shoot Forged. Shooting you doesn't gain me initiative, even if I succeed. Not to say I'm necessarily your best target, but circumstances might (and often do) dictate that that's the case.

When the doomsday clock reaches 0, the player who has the initiative wins! But think of that as the side-effect, and initiative as being the immediate effect. Its strategic value (having won the battle) comes from its tactical value (initiative).



# A Combat Round

A smaller, weaker company starts the battle with more points than a larger, stronger one. These points are initiative.

> Let's say that I'm fielding Captain Hattapon with 4 of her grasher shock marines, J is fielding a 4-frame contingent of Estar's Anvil, and you're fielding a deprivation-trained excursionary cell of 3 Ijad scramblers. With stations, I have 7 assets worth 3 each, J has 6 assets worth 5 each, and you have 5 assets worth 7 each. My initiative is 21, J's is 30, and yours is 35.

> At the beginning of the battle, My shock marines are advancing in a relaxed wedge and my point frame has just crossed your perimeter. J's Anvil, more tightly ranked, is approaching your position in parallel with my marines, three strides over and half a stride behind. We're eyeing each other warily. You're badly outgunned but you have an excellent vantage in solid cover overlooking the broad, coverless approach.

### In a Round

Each Mobile Frame gets one turn. The round ends when the last mobile frame's taken its turn.

During the round, we switch back and forth between initiative order and combat order, starting in initiative order.

As we destroy each others' mobile frames and seize each others' stations, we keep running initiative totals: Initiative = Assets x Asset Value.

After every Mobile Frame has taken its turn, we end the round.

### Initiative order

The round begins in initiative order.

In initiative order, always start with the player with the highest initiative.

When you have the initiative, you can (a) choose one of your available mobile frames and take its turn, or (b) pass to the player with the next-highest initiative. That player then has the same choice, and potentially the next player too, down to the player with the lowest initiative. However:

- Each mobile frame gets only one turn in a round, so if you've already taken all of your frames' turns, you have to pass.

- Every mobile frame has to take a turn in a round, so if there are no frames left to go after yours, you have to take a turn.

### Combat order

When one mobile frame attacks a mobile frame that hasn't taken its turn yet, switch to combat order.

In combat order, the attacking and defending mobile frames' turns overlap. The attacker takes the first part of its turn, the defender takes the first part of its turn, the attacker finishes its turn, and then the defender finishes its turn.

This counts as the defending mobile frame's turn for this round, naturally.

As defenders in turn attack targets of their own, combat order can cascade through a series of mobile frames' turns.

Once the cascade is done, return to initiative order to continue the round. Start as always with the player who has the highest initiative.

### A mobile frame's turn

I'll go into detail about this later. For now:

1. Name your target.
2. Gather and roll your dice.
3. Defend.
4-5. Attack then move, or move then attack.
6. Spot.

Here's how turn overlap in combat order works.

You have the initiative so you're up first. You decide not to pass, but to take one of your scramblers' turns. You choose the scrambler nearest my point frame.

Your 1. You name your target: my point frame.
Your 2. You gather and roll your dice.
Your 3. You defend.
Your 4. You decide to attack first, then move, so you attack!

In order to resolve the attack - see here - we need to know my frame's defense number. So we put your turn on hold, and:

My 1. I name my target: your frame that's attacking me.
My 2. I gather and roll my dice.
My 3. I defend.

Now we know my defense number. We resolve the attack - I take no damage because I AM AWESOME - and we finish your turn:

Your 5. You move. You fall back to tighten your defense.
Your 6. You spot.

That's the end of your frame's turn, but my frame's turn is still underway. We step back into it:

My 4. I decide to move before I attack, to keep range with you, so I advance.
My 5. I attack! We already know your defense number, so we resolve my attack with no further interruption. Let's say that I blow the snot out of you because I AM AWESOME.
My 6. I spot.

And that's the end of my frame's turn.

There's no frame whose turn is still underway. If I'd chosen to attack a frame who hadn't already taken its turn, there would be, but I didn't, so there isn't. This means that the combat order cascade ends and we go back to initiative order.

Initiative order always startes with the player with the high initiative. That's you, so it's your choice: choose one of your two remaining frames and take its turn, or pass to J?

### Running Initiative

The moment that any mobile frame is destroyed, recount that player's initiative.

The moment that any mobile frame seizes a station, recount both players' initiatives.

Initiative = Assets x Asset Value.

Your assets, recall, are your undestroyed Mobile Frames and the stations you control.

Destroying someone else's mobile frame costs them initiative points equal to their asset value. Seizing their station costs them initiative points equal to their asset value, and gains you initiative points equal to your own asset value.

### Ending the round

Once every mobile frame's had its turn, we end the round.

To end the round, we tidy the battlefield and count down to doomsday, but I'll explain those another time.


# When you come under attack

It's a sad fact in this imperfect, peach-impoverished world that sometimes you find yourself in the company of others who wish you harm.

You have a defense number from 0 to 6.
You may have been spotted first by another frame. If so, you have a spot number from 1 to 6.
Your attacker has an attack number from 1 to 8.

I'll explain where all those numbers come from later on. (Spoiler: from the dice you've rolled.) For now I want to talk just about resolving attacks.

Here's the all-important equation: Attack + Spot - Defense = Damage Dice.

So say that here I've got Captain Hattapon and her 6 hardass shock marines, and you've got some allegedly-free colonists in their ridiculous "hi-legs." One of them is tracking Captain Hattapon's mobile frame with a targeting laser and another opens up on her with those twin machine guns. Here are some possibilities:
- 6 Attack + 4 Spot - 5 Defense = 5 Damage Dice.
- 3 Attack + 1 Spot - 6 Defense = 0 Damage Dice. (There are no negative damage dice.)
- 8 Attack + 6 Spot - 2 Defense = 12 Damage Dice.

You pick up that many dice and roll them for damage:
- If Captain Hattapon's out of cover, a damage die hits her on a 5 or 6.
- If she's in cover, a damage die hits her on a 6, and hits her cover on a 4 or 5.
- If she's in cover behind another mobile frame, a damage die hits her on a 6, and the covering frame on a 5.
- If this had been a hand to hand attack instead, a damage die would hit her on a 4, 5 or 6(!)

For each damage die that hits her, she loses one of her systems. Once she's out of systems, she loses her white dice, one at a time. When the second white die goes, she's destroyed.

When one of my frames takes damage, I get to choose which system(s) it loses. It's small comfort! I was using those.

So say that you have the best luck you can really expect and you get 12 damage dice on her while she's out of cover. Of those 12 dice, it's likely that around 4 of them will be 5 or 6, so you'll probably inflict 4 damage on her. That'll leave her with only her white dice left - a catastrophic, disabling blow.

Or say that you get 5 damage dice on her while she's in cover. The order of damage is: cover first, starting with 4s, then the frame. So if your 5 damage dice come up 2 2 4 5 6, that first 4 blows bricks off her cover. Is the cover still intact? If so, the 5 hits it and the 6 hits her, but if not, now the 5 and the 6 both hit her.

Or crap, say that it's not a hi-leg with double machine guns it's a converted construction frame with a pair of repurposed jackhammers, and you just got 12 damage dice on her in a hand to hand attack. It's very possible that half of your damage dice will come up 4, 5 or 6, and you'll inflict 6 damage for a one hit kill.
